This project is a discrete time simulation network. The network contains two XORModels, which contains two inputs, and outputs the XOR result of said inputs, and one Memory Model, with one input, and one output. The first XOR Model takes its two inputs from the user, and pushes it to the second XOR Model, which takes its other input from the Memory, and it outputs to the Memory Model and the Network output. The network takes 3 internal ticks to calculate. THe network has the capability to go through the calculation tick by tick, letting you see each models states and outputs, and allows you to inject new inputs into the machine at any time.
