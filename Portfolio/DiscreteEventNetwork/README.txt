This project is a simplified discrete event simulation network. The simulation is a set of machines, a press and a drill, linked together to make washers. The program will prompt the user to input an amount of parts into the process, and then ask for the trajectory (what time to put the parts in). Parts are then put into the press, which requires 1.0 time units to process a part, and then passes the part to the drill, which takes 2.0 time units to process the part, and pushes that part to the networks output.
